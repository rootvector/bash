## Introduction

### History of linux and what is BASH?
**BASH** is a *Unix* shell and command language written by **Brian Fox** for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the *Bourne shell*.
A shell program is typically an executable *binary* that takes commands that you type.
Typically runs in a *text window* where user can interpret commands to carry out various actions.
Most mordern **linux and Unix** distributions provide a BASH shell by default.
> First Shell: Thompson (1971)
> Bourne-Again(Bash): Bash (1987)

### Terminal
A piece of equipment through which you could interact with a computer. today's *terminals* are software representations of the old physical terminals, often running on a GUI.
mainly helps in transimission of commands.
### Shell
A command interpreter whose main purpose is to run other programs. converts the command into a *kernel-understandable* form and passes it to the kernel.
Terminal passes the typed command to shell, which understands them and tells the kernel what to do.
